# Problem Solving with C++, Ninth Edition – Solutions to Exercises and Projects

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide solutions to the exercises and selected projects from *Problem Solving with C++, Ninth Edition* by Walter Savitch.  
This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in **C++ programming fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and practical problem-solving skills** through well-documented code examples.

* Each chapter has its own directory and README file.
* Each exercise solution is stored in a separate file within the corresponding chapter folder.
* Unless otherwise specified, each C++ file can be compiled individually on your device without extra files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xing-pangdingyu/Problem-Solving-with-Cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the chapter folder of interest:

   ```bash
   cd Problem-Solving-with-Cpp/Chapter_1
   ```
3. Open the **PDF** file (e.g., `C1_Solutions.pdf`) to view the solutions. Open LaTex file only if you want to review the code and comments.
